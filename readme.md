# The Pareto distribution applied to simulate the peruvian socioeconomic reality

## Introduction

The applications of statistical methods to economics have become a useful tool to understand some phenomenon regarding market interactions, socioeconomic groups and wealth distribution. According to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, the world’s richest 1 percent, those with more than $1 million, own 44 percent of the world’s wealth<sup id="re1">[1](#re1)</sup>. This seems unfair for the rest of the people who are in the bottom. Thus, it is assumed that the socioeconomic hierarchies are product of system injustice, excessive ambition and even violence in the capitalist modern society. However, this paper will attempt to demonstrate that economic hierarchies are formed even when those unfair factors are not taken into account by using an aleatory experiment (**this does not mean the system is free of injustices, which do happen around the world**).

This experiment consist on a group of `N` people who have an equal amount of money (`m`) in the beginning. Then, the agents form random pairs, bet money (`b > 0`) and toss a coin to decide who wins the transfer. If the loser does not have enough money to pay (`m < b`), the transaction does not take place. This process is repeated for many iterations (`i`) until we can see the tendency. The exchange represents as a market purchase. We claim that, in closed economic system where the money is constant, the money distribution will formed a Pareto distribution. Check the project documentation<sup id="re2">[2](#re2)</sup> for details.

The Pareto distribution is a power law statistical function which is used in social, scientific, geophysical and more knowledge fields, including economics regarding the global wealth distribution. Once verified the tendencies, we will try to simulate an ideal exchange of money in a free market context to see how money is distributed, considering the sociopolitical reality of Peruvian economy (incomes, expenses and taxes). Thus prove if inequality is necessarily created by injustice.

# Pareto distribution verification

## Version 0.5.0

- Implemented:
  - Ids for each person.
  - Changed the exchange formula, now we exchange random values depending on the status from both people, according to this:
    - A person from status E will exchange an amount between 1 and 100.
    - A person from status D will exchange an amount between 1 and 500.
    - A person from status C will exchange an amount between 1 and 1000.
    - A person from status B will exchange an amount between 1 and 5000.
    - A person from status A will exchange an amount between 1 and 10000.

    We will choose the minimal amount between those both random values, for example, if there is exchange between two people, one from E status and the other from the B status, then the amount of money will be limited by a random number between 1 a 100, since this is the limit for a person from E status.
- TODO:
  - Once exchanges stop, each category will receive its corresponding salary, showed below<sup>[1](#salary)</sup> (pending to assign a date).
  - Show the results in a graph (pending to assign a date).
  - Update the [`documentation`](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/Pareto-Distribution/blob/master/docs/readme.md) (pending to assign a date).

## Version 0.4.0

- Updated:
  - Dependencies
- TODO:
  - Once exchanges stop, each category will receive its corresponding salary, showed below<sup>[1](#salary)</sup> (pending to assign a date).
  - Show the results in a graph (pending to assign a date).

## Version 0.3.0

- Implemented:

  1. Requirements:
     - According to its category, after losing **X%** of its initial money, the _person_ can't perform any other exchange (done on 12-01-2021).

        1. A category: X = 62%.
        2. B category: X = 68%.
        3. C category: X = 75%.
        4. D category: x = 80%.
        5. E category: x = 87%.

- Updated:

  - `Eslint` rules.
  - Code in general.
  - Changelog file.

## Version 0.2.0

- Implemented:

  1. Requirements:

     - Optimization of the algorithm, pop the elements once they became 0 (done on Tuesday 26-05-2020).
     - Sort the array (done on Tuesday 26-05-2020). **Note**: [`Quicksort algorithm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) was used to do this task.
     - Increase the sample to 10000 (1000 was asked, done on Tuesday 26-05-2020). **Note**: The number of iterations must increase in order to visualize the real behavior of the `Pareto Distribution`.
     - <b id="salary"></b>Division in 5 categories that sample (done on Tuesday 26-05-2020):

       1. A category: 2% of the sample with 12660 soles as initial money and salary.
       2. B category: 10% of the sample with 7020 soles as initial money and salary.
       3. C category: 27% of the sample with 3970 soles as initial money and salary.
       4. D category: 27% of the sample with 2480 soles as initial money and salary.
       5. E category: 34% of the sample with 1300 soles as initial money and salary.

       **Note**: The salary wasn't implemented at this point; however, `.env` variables have been used to indicate the percent and the initial quantity of each status group.

  2. Extras:

     - [`CLI-Progress`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-progress), to visualize the progress of the exchanges while running the random experiment.
     - [`Colors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors), to have a better visualization of the output generated by the `CLI-Progress` bar.

- Updated:

  - `Eslint` rules.
  - Code in general.

- TODO:

  - According to its category, after losing **X%** of its initial money, the _person_ can't perform any other exchange (Wednesday 27-05-2020).

    1. A category: X = 62%.
    2. B category: X = 68%.
    3. C category: X = 75%.
    4. D category: x = 80%.
    5. E category: x = 87%.

  - Once exchanges stop, each category will receive its corresponding salary, showed above<sup>[2](#salary)</sup> (Friday 29-05-2020).
  - Show the results in a graph (pending to assign a date).
  - Update the [`documentation`](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/Pareto-Distribution/blob/master/docs/readme.md).

## Version 0.1.0

- Implemented:

  - First version of the simulation.
  - Writing in a file the results.
  - [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),to have better understand of the code.
  - [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/), to bundle the files.
  - [`Eslint`](https://eslint.org/), to have better code practices.
  - [`Prettier`](https://eslint.org/), to format the code.

- TODO:

  - Optimization of the algorithm, pop the elements once they became 0.
  - Sort the array (today 24-05-2020).
  - Increase the sample to 1000 (today 24-05-2020).
  - Divide in 5 categories that sample (Monday 25-05-2020):

    1. A category: 2% of the sample with 12660 soles as initial money and salary.
    2. B category: 10% of the sample with 7020 soles as initial money and salary.
    3. C category: 27% of the sample with 3970 soles as initial money and salary.
    4. D category: 27% of the sample with 2480 soles as initial money and salary.
    5. E category: 34% of the sample with 1300 soles as initial money and salary.

  - According to its category, after losing **X%** of its initial money, the _person_ can't perform any other exchange (Wednesday 27-05-2020).

    1. A category: X = 62%.
    2. B category: X = 68%.
    3. C category: X = 75%.
